## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df = read.csv("Heart.csv") # reading data saved in Working Directory and assigning to data.frame df
str(df) # displays structure of data frame df
df$AHD = factor(df$AHD) # to convert variable AHD from character to factor
names(df) # displays names of columns of df 
summary(df) # summarizes data
attach(df) # attaching df to R's search path
set.seed(872020)
train = sample(1:303, size = 203, replace = FALSE) 
df_train = df[train,] 
df_test = df[-train,] 
# Logistic Regression
glm.fit = glm(AHD ~ ., data = df_train, family = binomial) 
summary(glm.fit) 
glm.probs = predict(glm.fit, type = "response", newdata = df_test) 
glm.pred = ifelse(glm.probs > 0.5, "Yes", "No") 
table(Predicted = glm.pred, Actual = df_test$AHD)  
mean(glm.pred == df_test$AHD, na.rm=T) 

```
```{r}
library(tree)
attach(df) # attaching df to R's search path
set.seed(872020)
train = sample(1:303, size = 203, replace = FALSE) 
df_train = df[train,] 
df_test = df[-train,] 
```


```{r}
library(MASS) # MASS package must be installed
library(leaps) # leaps package must be installed 
str(Boston) # displays structure of data.
names(Boston) # shows names of columns (variables) of Boston data set. To know more about this data set, you may type ?Boston in the R Console window.

regfit.full = regsubsets(medv~., data = Boston, nvmax = 13) 
summary(regfit.full) 


```

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
